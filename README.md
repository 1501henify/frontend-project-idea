### Phlox Demo Business Website

\*\*\* This project was made 2 years ago back when I was starting my frontend development journey,

Revisited the code, and made some updates and improvements, a little bit of changes here and there, (gosh 🤦🏾‍♂️ so many lines of CSS code). After cross checking I seem to have trouble with the code written in [phlox.js lines 74-88](https://github.com/1501henify/frontend-project-idea/blob/main/assets/JS/phlox.js#L74-L88), [lines 279-363](https://github.com/1501henify/frontend-project-idea/blob/main/assets/CSS/media-queries.css#L279-L363), and in [menu style lines 120-126](https://github.com/1501henify/frontend-project-idea/blob/main/assets/CSS/phlox.css#L120-L126), any insights on how to go about it would be appreciated.

It was also done in Deutsch(German), would be committed once updated.

Thank you, Saying Good day ✌🏾.
